# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in C. It allows two players to take turns and play the game until there is a winner or a draw.

## How to Play

1. The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid with each cell numbered from 1 to 9 as shown below:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <table align="center">
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

2. Players take turns entering a number corresponding to the cell they want to mark with their symbol (X or O). Player 1 uses X, and Player 2 uses O.

3. To make a move, enter the number corresponding to the desired cell and press Enter.

4. The game continues until there is a winner or a draw. A player wins if they have three of their symbols (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game is a draw.
